The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in a mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys' fees when authorised by law, and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone/online and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law. Apart from the foregoing, each Party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the Party may incur. If a court decides that any provision of this section 13.2 is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the other parts of this section 13.2 shall still apply. In any case, the remainder of this Agreement, will continue to apply.
